# Deploy Yarr with Autometrics

This repository is a demo of changes and configurations necessary
to run [yarr](https://github.com/nkanaev/yarr), a Go application
to read RSS feeds, in smaller clouds.

This uses a fork and a branch of `yarr` which makes use of
[autometrics](https://github.com/autometrics-dev/autometrics-go)
to get metrics and alerts about the API.
